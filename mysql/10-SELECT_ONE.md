Let's break down `SELECT 1` completely.

### Part 1: What `SELECT 1` Does on Its Own

First, let's see what happens when you run this command by itself.

In SQL, `SELECT 1` is a simple query that tells the database: "Return a result set that has one column and one row, and put the number `1` in it."

If you run it, you'll get this:

```sql
MariaDB [punisher]> SELECT 1;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```

You can select any **literal** (a fixed value, not a column name) and it will do the same thing.

**Examples:**

```sql
MariaDB [punisher]> SELECT 'Hello Guwahati!';
+-----------------+
| Hello Guwahati! |
+-----------------+
| Hello Guwahati! |
+-----------------+

MariaDB [punisher]> SELECT 99;
+----+
| 99 |
+----+
| 99 |
+----+
```

So, `SELECT 1` on its own is just a way to return a single row with a `1` in it. But this isn't its real purpose. Its real power is when you use it inside an `EXISTS` clause.

### Part 2: The Real Meaning of `SELECT 1` inside `EXISTS`

This is the most important concept to understand:

When used inside an `EXISTS (...)` clause, the database **does not care what you put in the `SELECT` list**. It completely ignores the `1`, or `*`, or `column_name`.

The `EXISTS` clause has only one job: to check if the subquery **returns any rows at all**.

  * If the subquery finds **one or more rows**, `EXISTS` becomes **TRUE**.
  * If the subquery finds **zero rows**, `EXISTS` becomes **FALSE**.

Think of `EXISTS` as asking a simple Yes/No question: "**Did you find anything?**" It doesn't ask, "**What did you find?**"

#### Practical Examples with our `worker` Table

Let's see this in action.

**Example A: A subquery that finds something**

Imagine we want to check: "Does any worker exist in the 'Admin' department?"

```sql
-- This subquery will find Amit, Amitabh, Kiran, and Priya
SELECT 1 FROM worker WHERE Department = 'Admin';
```

Because this query finds 4 rows, the `EXISTS` condition becomes **TRUE**. The database doesn't care that it would have returned four `1`s; it just cares that the row count was not zero.

**Example B: A subquery that finds nothing**

Now let's check: "Does any worker exist in the 'Marketing' department?"

```sql
-- This subquery will find zero matching rows
SELECT 1 FROM worker WHERE Department = 'Marketing';
```

Because this query finds 0 rows, the `EXISTS` condition becomes **FALSE**.

### So, Why Not Use `SELECT *` or `SELECT first_name`?

You absolutely could\! These queries would work exactly the same way:

```sql
-- THIS WORKS and gives the same result
... NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM worker w2 WHERE ...);

-- THIS ALSO WORKS and gives the same result
... NOT EXISTS (SELECT w2.first_name FROM worker w2 WHERE ...);
```

The `EXISTS` clause would still only check if any rows were returned.

However, using `SELECT 1` is a widely adopted **convention and a performance best practice** for two main reasons:

1.  **Performance:** `SELECT 1` is the most efficient way to ask the question. The database knows it doesn't need to look up any column names (like with `*`) or retrieve any actual data from the table's columns (like with `first_name`). It just needs to find a row that matches the `WHERE` clause and stop. It's a micro-optimization, but a good habit.

2.  **Clarity and Intent:** When another developer reads your code and sees `EXISTS (SELECT 1 ...)`, they immediately know that you are **only checking for the existence of a row**. You are signaling that you don't care about the actual data in the row. It makes the code's purpose clearer.

## Q. Can't we get only one value? 

```sql 
MariaDB [punisher]> SELECT 'true'  FROM worker WHERE Department != 'Marketing';
+------+
| true |
+------+
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
| true |
+------+
10 rows in set (0.000 sec)

```

Ah, I see what you’re asking 👍 — right now your query:

```sql
SELECT 'true'
FROM worker
WHERE Department != 'Marketing';
```

returns one `'true'` for **each row** that satisfies the condition. That’s why you get 10 rows of `'true'`.

If you only want **one result (a single true/false)**, you need to aggregate or limit the output. Here are some common approaches:

---

### ✅ Option 1: Use `EXISTS` (boolean-like result)

```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM worker
    WHERE Department != 'Marketing'
) AS result;
```

This will return `1` if at least one row satisfies the condition, otherwise `0`.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use `CASE` with `COUNT`

```sql
SELECT CASE 
         WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 'true' 
         ELSE 'false' 
       END AS result
FROM worker
WHERE Department != 'Marketing';
```

This ensures you always get exactly one row: `'true'` if such rows exist, `'false'` otherwise.

---

### ✅ Option 3: Use `LIMIT 1`

```sql
SELECT 'true' AS result
FROM worker
WHERE Department != 'Marketing'
LIMIT 1;
```

This will return `'true'` **only once** if at least one row matches. If no rows match, you get an empty result set.

---

👉 The cleanest solution if you want a **yes/no check** is probably **Option 1 (`EXISTS`)**.

Do you want me to also show you how to flip it so you get `'false'` when *all* rows are Marketing?
