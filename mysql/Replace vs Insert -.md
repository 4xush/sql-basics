Replace vs Insert -

If row is present then replace will replace the column value
with the give column value and rest of that row's attribute will become null
It needs the primary key in column must;
If the row is not present then it will just insert this as new row while UPDATE do nothing;

Insert is to add a row in a table for the first time;
