# Train Route Query Examples

This document provides examples of SQL queries on the `TrainRoutes` table to list existing reverse route pairs and remove reverse pairs using different methods.

## 1. Listing Existing Reverse Pairs

First, display all train routes:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TrainRoutes;
```

**Example Output:**

```
+---------+-----------+----------+
| TrainNo | From_City | To_City  |
+---------+-----------+----------+
|   12023 | Kolkata   | Patna    |
|   12024 | Patna     | Kolkata  |
|   12389 | Gaya      | Chennai  |
|   12505 | Guwahati  | Delhi    |
|   12506 | Delhi     | Guwahati |
+---------+-----------+----------+
```

To list pairs of routes that are reverses of each other using a self join:

```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM TrainRoutes t1
INNER JOIN TrainRoutes t2
  ON t2.To_City = t1.From_City;
```

**This returns:**

```
+---------+-----------+----------+
| TrainNo | From_City | To_City  |
+---------+-----------+----------+
|   12024 | Patna     | Kolkata  |
|   12023 | Kolkata   | Patna    |
|   12506 | Delhi     | Guwahati |
|   12505 | Guwahati  | Delhi    |
+---------+-----------+----------+
```

To avoid duplicate reverse pairs, add a filtering condition:

```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM TrainRoutes t1
INNER JOIN TrainRoutes t2
  ON t2.To_City = t1.From_City
WHERE t1.TrainNo < t2.TrainNo;
```

This returns one row per reversible pair:

```
+---------+-----------+---------+
| TrainNo | From_City | To_City |
+---------+-----------+---------+
|   12023 | Kolkata   | Patna   |
|   12505 | Guwahati  | Delhi   |
+---------+-----------+---------+
```

## 2. Removing Reverse Pairs Using JOIN

### Explanation

The JOIN method uses a LEFT JOIN to identify reverse pairs. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TrainRoutes t1
LEFT JOIN TrainRoutes t2
  ON t2.To_City = t1.From_City;
```

This returns all routes alongside their reverse match (if available). To filter out duplicate reverse pairs and retain only one instance, use:

```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM TrainRoutes t1
LEFT JOIN TrainRoutes t2
  ON t2.To_City = t1.From_City
WHERE t1.From_City < t1.To_City
   OR t2.From_City IS NULL;
```

**Example Output:**

```
+---------+-----------+----------+
| TrainNo | From_City | To_City  |
+---------+-----------+----------+
|   12023 | Kolkata   | Patna    |
|   12506 | Delhi     | Guwahati |
|   12389 | Gaya      | Chennai  |
+---------+-----------+----------+
```

## 3. Removing Reverse Pairs Using a Correlated Subquery


### ðŸ”¹ 1. The `NOT EXISTS` logic

You wrote: WRONG QUERY - 

```sql
select * 
from TrainRoutes t1  
where not exists (
    select * 
    from TrainRoutes t2  
    where t1.from_city = t2.to_city 
      and t1.to_city   = t2.from_city 
      and t1.from_city > t2.to_city
);
```

This says:
*"Give me those routes where there is **no reverse route** in the table **with an extra condition** (`t1.from_city > t2.to_city`)."*

But because of the **extra condition** `t1.from_city > t2.to_city`, the reverse pairs are not being detected properly.
For example:

* (Kolkata â†’ Patna) vs (Patna â†’ Kolkata)

  * Here Kolkata is not greater than Patna alphabetically â†’ so the condition fails â†’ the reverse exists but your subquery doesnâ€™t catch it.
  * So both rows still survive, even though they are actually reversible pairs.

---

CORRECT ONE - 

### Explanation

The correlated subquery method leverages the `NOT EXISTS` clause to filter out reverse routes. Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TrainRoutes t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM TrainRoutes t2
    WHERE t1.From_City = t2.To_City
      AND t1.To_City   = t2.From_City
);
```

This query excludes any route that has a reverse pair. If your intent is to remove one duplicate from each reverse pair, add a further condition to determine which row to keep. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TrainRoutes t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM TrainRoutes t2
    WHERE t1.From_City = t2.To_City
      AND t1.To_City   = t2.From_City
      AND t1.From_City > t2.From_City
);
```

In this query, the condition `t1.From_City > t2.From_City` ensures that only one route of the reversible pair is returned by discarding the duplicate.

here (Patna â†’ Kolkata) vs (Kolkata â†’ Patna)

 Here Patna is greater than Kolkata alphabetically â†’ so the condition true â†’ the reverse exists and now subquery does catch it.
  * So only one row will survive.
