In MySQL/MariaDB, case sensitivity depends on what youâ€™re talking about:

1. ðŸ”¹ Database and Table Names

On Linux/Unix (like Fedora), table names and database names ARE case-sensitive, because theyâ€™re stored as actual files in the filesystem.

So Title â‰  title â‰  TITLE.

On Windows/macOS, they are usually case-insensitive.

ðŸ‘‰ In your case (Fedora), since you see both Title and worker, if you try:

SELECT * FROM title;

youâ€™ll get an error (because the table is Title with capital T).
