Great question ðŸ™Œ â€” what you did there (putting a `SELECT` inside the `FROM` clause, giving it an alias, and then querying from it) is called a **Derived Table** or **Inline View** in SQL.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Derived Table?

* A **derived table** is a temporary, unnamed result set created by a subquery inside the `FROM` clause.
* It behaves like a **virtual table** that only exists for the duration of the outer query.
* You **must give it an alias** (like `AS subquery`), otherwise SQL doesnâ€™t know what to call that temporary table.

Itâ€™s different from:

* **Physical tables** â†’ actual tables stored in your database.
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** â†’ similar, but declared with `WITH` before the query.

---

## âœ… Example

Imagine you have a table `sales`:

| id | product | amount |
| -- | ------- | ------ |
| 1  | A       | 100    |
| 2  | B       | 200    |
| 3  | A       | 150    |
| 4  | C       | 50     |

Now letâ€™s say you want the **maximum sale per product** and then pick the highest among those.

### Step 1: Create derived table

```sql
SELECT product, MAX(amount) AS max_sale
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
```

This gives:

| product | max\_sale |
| ------- | --------- |
| A       | 150       |
| B       | 200       |
| C       | 50        |

---

### Step 2: Use it as a derived table

```sql
SELECT MAX(max_sale) AS overall_max
FROM (
    SELECT product, MAX(amount) AS max_sale
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product
) AS t;
```

Here:

* The inner query creates a **derived table `t`** (with `product` and `max_sale`).
* The outer query calculates the maximum from that derived table.

---

## ðŸ’¡ When to use Derived Tables?

* When you need to **reuse aggregated results**.
* When you need to **filter after grouping** (without window functions).
* When you want to **simplify complex joins** step by step.

---

ðŸ‘‰ So in your original query about "second highest salary", the method you used is exactly this concept: **using a derived table (inline view)**.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM worker
    WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM worker)
);
```

I see the issue ðŸ‘€. The error happens because in MariaDB (and MySQL), when you use a **subquery in the `FROM` clause**, you **must give it an alias**.

Your query is almost correct, just missing the alias.

---

### âœ… Correct version:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM worker
    WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM worker)
) AS subquery;
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Explanation:

* The inner query finds all rows where salary is **less than the maximum salary**.
* Wrapping it as a derived table (`subquery`) requires an alias (`AS subquery`), otherwise MariaDB throws a syntax error.
* The outer query then finds the `MAX(salary)` from that reduced set â†’ effectively giving you the **second highest salary**.

**With deatils :**

```sql
MariaDB [punisher]> select * from worker where salary = (SELECT MAX(salary
) FROM (     SELECT *     FROM worker     WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salar
y) FROM worker) ) AS subquery);

+-----------+------------+-----------+--------+---------------------+------------+
| WORKER_ID | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME | SALARY | JOINING_DATE        | DEPARTMENT |
+-----------+------------+-----------+--------+---------------------+------------+
|         2 | Amitabh    | Singh     | 470000 | 2014-02-20 09:00:00 | Admin      |
|         5 | Suresh     | Nair      | 470000 | 2022-08-17 14:00:00 | Finance    |
+-----------+------------+-----------+--------+---------------------+------------+

 ```
ðŸ‘‰ Even shorter, you could write it as:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM worker
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM worker);
```

This does the same thing without needing a derived table.
